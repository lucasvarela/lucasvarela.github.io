  Soft matter often features charged units. These charges interact through Coulomb forces, the treatment of which is difficult due to their long-range nature. 
  This thesis gives results for three many-body systems where every long-range interaction is included, without approximations. 
  In Chapter 1, we report exact results for a one-dimensional electroneutral salt-free suspension made of two fixed colloids and N neutralizing mobile counterions, 
  with dielectric jumps at the colloids' position. This includes the partition function, density profile and pressure. Moreover, 
  the known relation between the contact density and pressure when counterions are confined between the colloids is generalized to the permeable situation. 
  We find that for any N counterions system there may be like-charge attraction, unlike when the dielectric is homogeneous in which case N must be even. 
  In the limit N → ∞ at fixed colloid's charge, the mean-field (i.e. Poisson-Boltzmann equation) prediction is recovered. 
  In Chapter 2, we consider the previous system out of equilibrium within a homogeneous dielectric space, as a model for the dynamics of two electrical double-layers. 
  Using a combination of exact calculations where possible and Brownian dynamics simulations, we compute the relaxation time towards equilibrium (τ). 
  The parity of N is determinant for the relaxation dynamics: when odd, the two double-layers never decouple, irrespective of their separation L; 
  this is the regime of like-charge attraction, where τ exhibits a diffusive scaling in L² for large L. Contrarily, for even N, the relevant length scale is the Bjerrum length instead of L. 
  This leads to distinctly different dynamics: for N even, thermal effects are detrimental to relaxation, increasing τ, while they accelerate relaxation for N odd. 
  We also show the dynamical mean-field theory (i.e. Poisson-Nernst-Planck equation) is recovered for large N, remaining operational down to a few counterions (N>3). 
  In Chapter 3, we determine exactly the short-distance effective potential between two ``guest'' charges immersed in a two-dimensional two-component charge-asymmetric plasma composed of 
  positively (q₁ = +1) and negatively (q₂ = -1/2) charged point particles. The result is valid in the collapse-free regime, where the Coulombic coupling (dimensionless inverse temperature) β <4. 
  At high Coulombic coupling β >2, this model features like-charge attraction. Finally, we show opposite-charges cannot repel at short-distances.

  Also, there cannot be repulsion between opposite-charges at short-distances, at variance with large-distance interactions.

  We consider an out-of-equilibrium one-dimensional model for two electrical double-layers. With a combination of exact calculations and Brownian dynamics simulations, 
  we compute the relaxation time (τ) for an electroneutral salt-free suspension, made up of two fixed colloids, with N neutralizing mobile counterions. For N odd, the two double-layers never decouple, 
  irrespective of their separation L; this is the regime of like-charge attraction, where τ exhibits a diffusive scaling in L² for large L. 
  On the other hand, for even N, L no longer is the relevant length scale for setting the relaxation time; this role is played by the Bjerrum length. 
  This leads to distinctly different dynamics: for N even, thermal effects are detrimental to relaxation, increasing τ, 
  while they accelerate relaxation for N odd. Finally, we also show that the mean-field theory is recovered for large N and moreover, 
  that it remains an operational treatment down to relatively small values of N (N > 3).

  We consider a one-dimensional model allowing analytical derivation of the effective interactions between two charged colloids. 
  We evaluate exactly the partition function for an electroneutral salt-free suspension with dielectric jumps at the colloids' position. 
  We derive a contact relation with the pressure that shows there is like-charge attraction, whether or not the counterions are confined between the colloids. 
  In contrast to the homogeneous dielectric case, there is the possibility for the colloids to attract despite the number of counterions (N) being even. 
  The results are shown to recover the mean-field prediction in the limit N → ∞.

  abstract={
  We study a one-dimensional Coulomb system, where two charged colloids are neutralized by a collection of point counterions, with global neutrality. 
  With temperature being given, two situations are addressed: 
  Either the colloids are kept at fixed positions (canonical ensemble) or the force acting on the colloids is fixed (isobaric-isothermal ensemble). 
  The corresponding partition functions are worked out exactly, in view of determining which arrangement of counterions is optimal. 
  How many counterions should be in the confined segment between the colloids? 
  For the remaining ions outside, is there a left-right symmetry breakdown? 
  We evidence a cascade of transitions as system size is varied in the canonical treatment or as pressure is increased in the isobaric formulation.
