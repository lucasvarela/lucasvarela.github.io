  abstract={We consider a one-dimensional model allowing analytical derivation of the effective interactions between two charged colloids. We evaluate exactly the partition function for an electroneutral salt-free suspension with dielectric jumps at the colloids' position. We derive a contact relation with the pressure that shows there is like-charge attraction, whether or not the counterions are confined between the colloids. In contrast to the homogeneous dielectric case, there is the possibility for the colloids to attract despite the number of counterions (N) being even. The results are shown to recover the mean-field prediction in the limit N → ∞.},

  abstract={We study a one-dimensional Coulomb system, where two charged colloids are neutralized by a collection of point counterions, with global neutrality. With temperature being given, two situations are addressed: Either the colloids are kept at fixed positions (canonical ensemble) or the force acting on the colloids is fixed (isobaric-isothermal ensemble). The corresponding partition functions are worked out exactly, in view of determining which arrangement of counterions is optimal. How many counterions should be in the confined segment between the colloids? For the remaining ions outside, is there a left-right symmetry breakdown? We evidence a cascade of transitions as system size is varied in the canonical treatment or as pressure is increased in the isobaric formulation.},
