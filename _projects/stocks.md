As a young adult, I became interested in investing, particularly in the stock market. I think it's a way of believing in my country's internal economy while growing the capital I have earned so far in hope of a more stable future. 

This project is a result of my analysis of the Colombian stock market's behaviour. We retrieve historic data of transactions for all the companies, before and during the pandemic. Since Colombia is a small and traditional country, stocks change a lot based on politics or news, so the goal here is to determine the tendencies of the historic financial movements. Hopefully to understand better how the macro system works, but also to take actions on it.
