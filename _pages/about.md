Hi. I'm Lucas. Welcome to my website. 

I'm a theoretical physicist specialized in statistical mechanics and soft condesed matter. I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Physics at [Universit√© Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) and [Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en). 

As a scientist I am trained to solve problems with an analytical approach that focuses on finding the best tools and knowledge for each particular task. Due to the inherent collaborative nature of science I am an excellent team player that knows how to aid with his strengths and constantly improve on his weaknesses. These skills have lead to manage data, statistically interpret it and propose successful models in physical systems. 

Here you can view my work with further detail:
