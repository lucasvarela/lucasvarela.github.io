Hi. I'm Lucas. Welcome to my website. 

I'm a data scientist and theoretical physicist specialized in statistical mechanics. I completed my PhD in Physics at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en) in the 
[Laboratoire de Physique Théorique et Modèles Statistiques](http://lptms.u-psud.fr/en/) (LPTMS) at alliance with [Universidad de los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/en) (Colombia). 

As a scientist I am trained to solve problems with an analytical approach that focuses on finding the best tools and knowledge for each particular task. Due to the inherent collaborative nature of science I am an excellent team player that knows how to aid with his strengths and constantly improve on his weaknesses. These skills have lead to manage data, statistically interpret it and propose successful models in physical systems. 

Among my particular interests are: Stochastic Processes, Statistics, Computational Physics, Statistical Mechanics, Colloid Physics, Soft Condensed Matter, Data Science and Machine Learning.

Here you can view my work with further detail:

* the [projects](https://lucasvarela.github.io/projects/) I have worked on
* the [publications](https://lucasvarela.github.io/publications/) I have contributed to
* the [teaching](https://lucasvarela.github.io/teaching/) resources I have gathered

Finally, here's my condensed [CV](https://lucasvarela.github.io/assets/pdf/CV.pdf). Feel free to contact me via email at [l.varela10@uniandes.edu.co](mailto:l.varela10@uniandes.edu.co) or any of the social connections listed above.
